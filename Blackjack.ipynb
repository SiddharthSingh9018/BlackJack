    "2. **Player Actions**: The player should be able to:\n",
    "   - Stand or hit\n",
    "   - Choose their betting amount\n",
    "3. **Bankroll Management**: Keep track of the player's total money and update it based on wins or losses.\n",
    "4. **Game Feedback**: Alert the player of wins, losses, busts, etc.\n",
    "5. **Object-Oriented Programming**: Use classes to define at least:\n",
    "   - A `Card` class to represent individual cards.\n",
    "   - A `Deck` class to manage the deck of cards.\n",
    "   - A `Hand` class to manage the cards held by the player and dealer.\n",

    "4. Show one of the dealer's cards and both of the player's cards.\n",
    "5. Allow the player to choose to hit or stand.\n",
    "6. If the player stands, reveal the dealer's hand and play according to the rules (dealer hits until reaching 17).\n",

Jacks, Queens and Kings all have a rank of 10. Aces have a rank of either 11 or 1 as needed to reach 21 without busting. As a starting point in your program, you may want to assign variables to store a list of suits, ranks, and then use a dictionary to map ranks to values."
